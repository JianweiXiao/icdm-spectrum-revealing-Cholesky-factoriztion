This folder contains the codes for numerical experiment D in the paper "Spectrum-Revealing Cholesky Factorization for Kernel Methods". The codes are based on the matlab codes from the paper "Predictive low-rank decomposition for kernel methods Francis"

Implementation: 
run my_comparison_digit.m, you will get the figure 4 and figure 5. To get figure 6, modify the parameter m to [50,100,150,200] and obtain the run time. To get figure 6, run running_time_csi_srch.m
